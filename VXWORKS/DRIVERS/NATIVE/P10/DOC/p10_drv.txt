P10/P11 Plain Text Short Manual
===============================

	1. Introduction
	2. The Files You Need
	3. Compiling
	4. Running the Driver


1. Introduction
---------------

The P10/P11 is a quad serial module in PC-MIP format. The P10 supports
four serial channels, two with full modem line support and two with RTS/CTS
lines only. The four channels of the P11 are build as 4-wire (RS422)
or 2-wire (RS485) serial devices. The wire mode is selectable either by 
hardware or software. On board is a Oxford 16C954 UART compatible to 16C450/550/650
but with 128 Byte FIFO und baudrate up to 1.152 MBaud.


2. The Files You Need
---------------------

The neccessary files are:

	/DOC/p10_drv.txt	this file
	p10_drv.c		the driver source
	p10_drv.h		the header source
	makef.mak		the makefile for the driver
	mk.bat			the batchfile for compiling the driver for the desired CPU


Additionally there are some files for test and docu:
	/TEST/p10_test.c	a test utility for the module/driver
	/TEST/p10_test.txt	a short intro to the test
	/TEST/makef.mak		the make file for the test
	/TEST/mk.bat		the batchfile for calling the makefile

	/EEPROM/oxprom.c	a utility for writing the defaults to the P10 EEPROM
	/EEPROM/oxprom.h	the headerfile
	/EEPROM/oxprom.txt	a short intro to oxprom
	/EEPROM/makef.mak	the makefile for oxprom
	/EEPROM/mk.bat		the batchfile to call the makefile


3. Compiling
------------

For compiling the P10/P11 driver for the desired CPU type you have to modify
the mk.bat file. Just comment or uncomment the CPU type you want to compile the
driver for. Of course you must set the environment variables for the desired compiler.


4. Running the Driver
---------------------

For running the driver load its object file and call p10Drv. Stick to the PDF manual
for the arguments of the driver.



have fun ;-)
